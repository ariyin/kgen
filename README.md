an exploration of how k-pop has evolved across generations through musical and stylistic analysis.

## inspirations

**name**: a play on the familiar "k-" prefix (as in k-pop, k-drama) and also draws from the mathematical use of k as a variable â€” symbolizing any given generation.

**logo**: from the logos of BLACKPIN**K**, BIGBAN**G**, BOYN**E**XTDOOR, and E**N**HYPEN.

**color scheme**: BOYNEXTDOOR's "19.99" album art. (great album!)
