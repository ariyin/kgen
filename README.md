An exploration of K-pop’s evolution across generations through musical and stylistic analysis, created for Spring 2025’s Digital Humanities 187. The name "kgen" is a play on the familiar “K-” prefix (as in K-pop, K-drama) and also draws from the mathematical use of k as a variable — symbolizing any given generation.
